                        <p>My interest in architecture began early, inspired by my dad, who’s an engineer. However, over time, I’ve found myself drawn to the world of game development. Games like Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft have sparked my creativity and deepened my passion for designing virtual worlds. Now, I’m excited to blend my engineering background with my love for gaming and pursue a career as a developer, where I can bring both my technical skills and creative ideas to life.</p>

                        <h2>Anime</h2>
                        <p>A few years ago, I stumbled upon the world of anime, and it completely opened up new doors for me. Since then, I’ve branched out into reading graphic novels, manga, and comic books, while also diving into live-action shows and movies inspired by comics—especially Marvel and DC. My passion for these genres has led me to build a deep knowledge of all things pop culture, from iconic superheroes to lesser-known gems. This has made me a go-to person for discussing everything from the latest anime series to superhero movie lore, and I love having insightful conversations with others who share the same interests.</p>

                        <p>Another passion of mine is astrology, which has fascinated me since I was a kid. I’ve always been drawn to the stars, captivated by the breathtaking beauty of the vast, mysterious expanse of space. There’s something profound about the unknown—about the endless worlds out there and how tiny we are in the grand scheme of the universe. Even now, I find myself occasionally diving into research on space exploration, still in awe of what lies beyond our understanding. The more I learn, the more I appreciate the wonder and scale of it all.</p>

                        <h2>Art</h2>
                        <p>I’m passionate about art and have honed my skills in a variety of styles, including manga, anime, and comics. I’m able to create dynamic characters and scenes without the need for guidelines, showcasing my ability to bring imagination to life on paper. Recently, I've expanded my skills to include coloring and drawing more realistic portraits, while mastering shading techniques with pen, ink, and pencil. I’m also diving into digital art, beginning to explore color blending, and constantly pushing myself to improve. With expertise in manga, Marvel comics, and semi-realistic character design, I’m always excited to explore new artistic challenges and grow my craft!</p>
